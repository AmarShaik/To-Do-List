# To-Do-List
To Do List using ReactJS
This is a React Practice Project


What I Used
 - React functional components

Props for passing data between components

State (useState) for managing the to-do list dynamically

Basic event handling (like adding and deleting tasks)

Simple conditional rendering and JSX logic
